### Introduction

This project, titled _An Events Management System for a Training Course Provider_, explores the problem of an ineffective workflow in a real-world system and how the development of a software system can help solve that problem. The project uses a problem statement and supplementary domain descriptions and rules to provide context to the problem and establish a foundation for modelling the problem domain.

The domain is then refined through a process of requirements elicitation where interviews with project stakeholders take place. The output of this process is analysed to produce a logical model that describes the entities and their relationships within the domain and the processes and rules that govern functionality and constraints.

Through the design and implementation process, the model transforms into a working software system that is then tested against the original problem statement and set of requirements to verify the individual components of the system meet their specification, and the completed solution is valid.

The goal of this project is to develop a software system that provides a high-quality solution to the problem outlined in the problem statement. In achieving this goal, many legal, social, and ethical concerns associated with the business will be considered, and the impact of a successful solution will be analysed.
